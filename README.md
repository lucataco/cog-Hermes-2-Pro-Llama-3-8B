# NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B Cog Model

This is an implementation of [NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B) as a [Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) model.

## Development

Follow the [model pushing guide](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/push-a-model) to push your own fork of SDXL to [Replicate](https://replicate.com).

## Basic Usage

To run a normal prediction:

    cog predict -i prompt="Hello, who are you?" -i system_prompt="You are "Hermes 2", a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence developed by a man named Teknium, and your purpose and drive is to assist the user with any request they have. You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia."

For a function call prediction:

    cog predict -i prompt="Fetch the stock fundamentals data for Tesla (TSLA)"  -i system_prompt="ou are a function calling AI model. You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags. You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query. Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Here are the available tools: <tools> {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_stock_fundamentals", "description": "get_stock_fundamentals(symbol: str) -> dict - Get fundamental data for a given stock symbol using yfinance API.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        symbol (str): The stock symbol.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        dict: A dictionary containing fundamental data.\\n            Keys:\\n                - \'symbol\': The stock symbol.\\n                - \'company_name\': The long name of the company.\\n                - \'sector\': The sector to which the company belongs.\\n                - \'industry\': The industry to which the company belongs.\\n                - \'market_cap\': The market capitalization of the company.\\n                - \'pe_ratio\': The forward price-to-earnings ratio.\\n                - \'pb_ratio\': The price-to-book ratio.\\n                - \'dividend_yield\': The dividend yield.\\n                - \'eps\': The trailing earnings per share.\\n                - \'beta\': The beta value of the stock.\\n                - \'52_week_high\': The 52-week high price of the stock.\\n                - \'52_week_low\': The 52-week low price of the stock.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"symbol": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["symbol"]}}}  </tools> Use the following pydantic model json schema for each tool call you will make: {"properties": {"arguments": {"title": "Arguments", "type": "object"}, "name": {"title": "Name", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["arguments", "name"], "title": "FunctionCall", "type": "object"} For each function call return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags as follows:
    <tool_call>
    {"arguments": <args-dict>, "name": <function-name>}
    </tool_call>"

For a json response prediction:

    cog predict -i prompt="Create a list of new book titles for kids between the ages of 5-8"  -i system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant that answers in JSON. Here's the json schema you must adhere to:\n<schema>\n{schema}\n</schema>"
